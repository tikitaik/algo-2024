- as many points in time limit

task :  
    define model to hold required information for an event
    develop algo for optimal path through the park
    use the model to compare team efficiency

to store points: 
    linkedlist of float array (int points, x coord, y coord)?
    dictionary?

event register
    start coordinates
    end coordinates
    linked list of goals
    linked list of teams
    

team ADT
    team member count (int)
    team member names and ages (dictionary <strings, names>, or linkedList of tuple of strings and name), size is team member count
    time of arrival (time date type)
    time of finishing (time data type)
    starting bracket (something about leaving 10 minutes apart, six of them)
    armband register (linkedList of nodes : format : goal, time visited)

goal ADT
    x coordinate (float)
    y coordinate (float)
    point reward (int)
    location register (dictionary <team, time visited>, or linkedList of nodes that have team and time visited)
